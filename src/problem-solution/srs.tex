\section{Software Requirements Specification}\label{sec:software-requirements-specification}
% textidote: ignore end

The outline of the requirements of the program is divided into four categories: essential requirements labeled as
``Must-haves (Mo),'' desirable requirements labeled as ``Should-haves (S),'' and ``Could-haves (Co),'' and
undesirable requirements as ``Won't-haves (W).''
The requirements are made by taking use of the MOSCOW model as it narrows our program to what is realistically
achievable~\cite{hudaib2018requirements}.

``Must-haves (Mo)'' include all functions of the program that are necessary and must be included and implemented. In
contrast, ``Should-haves (S)'' and ``Could-haves (Co)'' include functions that are desirable but not critical to
the core functionality of the program.

The requirements are based on the personas in figure~\ref{fig:persona_asger},~\ref{fig:persona_josefine} and
~\ref{fig:persona_martin}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate user input
    \item Get requests from Rejseplanenâ€™s API
    \item Compare routes
    \item Evaluate the weighing of routes
    \item Output calculated data based on a route to the console
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Should-haves (S)}\label{subsec:should-haves}
% textidote: ignore end

\begin{itemize}
    \item Search and choose stops
    \item Use a map-related API
    \item Cross-platform compatibility
\end{itemize}

% textidote: ignore begin
\subsection{Could-haves (Co)}\label{subsec:could-haves}
% textidote: ignore end

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sort journeys by health preferences like stress or physical activity
    \item Graphical user interface (GUI)
    \item Desktop/mobile/web application
\end{itemize}
% textidote: ignore begin
\subsection{Won't-haves}\label{subsec:wont-haves}
% textidote: ignore end

\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced security features like encryption or user authentication
    \item User health tracking or personalized health recommendations
    \item Real-time updates to a shown journey.
\end{itemize}

The following flowcharts and analysis of the program will encompass these requirements.
