\section{Software Requirements Specification}\label{sec:software-requirements-specification}
% textidote: ignore end

The outline of the requirements of the program is divided into four categories: hard requirements labeled as
``Must-haves'', soft requirements labeled as ``Should-haves'' and ``Could-haves'' and
unneeded requirements as ``Won't-haves''
The requirements are made by taking use of the MoSCoW model as it narrows our program to what is realistically
achievable~\cite{hudaib2018requirements}.
``Must-haves'' include all functions of the program that are necessary and must be included and implemented.
In contrast, ``Should-haves'' and ``Could-haves'' include functions that are desirable but not critical to
the core functionality of the program.
``Won't-haves'' are functions that are not included in the program, but could be included in the future.
The requirements are based on the personas from Section~\ref{subsec:persona}.
