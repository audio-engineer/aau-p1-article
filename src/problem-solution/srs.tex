% textidote: ignore end


The outline of the requirements of the program is divided into two categories; hard requirements labeled ``need to
have's'' and soft requirements labeled ``nice to have's''.
% textidote: ignore begin
``Need to have's''
% textidote: ignore end
include all functions of the program which is expected to be included and implemented.
In contrast, the ``nice to have's'' include functions which are out of scope of this report, but would improve the
program if implemented.

    \item Able to compare routes
    \item Able to evaluate weighing of routes
    \item Able to output some data calculated based on a route to the console
\end{itemize}

% textidote: ignore begin
\subsection{Nice to have}\label{subsec:nice-to-have}
% textidote: ignore end
