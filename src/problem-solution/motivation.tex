We believe that the reason for these challenges is the complexity of obtaining high-quality information, thus reducing

By giving potential commuters an application to plan their route according to their preferences, many more would try
commuting by public transport or otherwise carbon-emission friendly options, which in turn would improve everyone's
quality of life.

This project attempts to develop a decision-support system tailored to aid individuals struggling with the choice of
commuting, aiming to integrate diverse commuting strategies into a compact and efficient application solution.

By addressing the multifaceted nature of commuting decisions, our solution seeks to optimize commuting choices,
considering cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, and environmental impact, thus assisting individuals in making
informed and balanced decisions about their commuting commitments.
