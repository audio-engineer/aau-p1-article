\subsection{Apple Maps}\label{subsec:apple-maps}

The software already mentioned are two of the most important software for personal transportation.
Rejseplanen specifically focused on Denmark and Google Maps which is focussed around the whole globe.
Another software which has some of the same capabilities is Apple Maps.

Apple Maps is mostly the same as Google Maps, it also has very detailed mapping data.
Apple Maps also provides navigation function like Google Maps that is with turn-by-turn directions for driving, walking
and public transportation.
It also supports real-time traffic information and alternative routes to help users reach their destination more
efficiently.
Apple Maps can provide various information about shopping centers, restaurants, hotels and gas stations.
Some of that information includes user reviews, photos, contact details and hours of operation.
Google Maps does also provide this kind of information.

Google Maps used to be the default web mapping service for iOS, but they replaced Google Maps with their own version
which is of course Apple Maps now~\cite{applemaps2023}.
