\section{The Health Attribute}\label{sec:health-attribute}

The topic of the task specifically mentions four attributes - price, time, comfortability and environment.
When working on analyzing the problem, we looked into each of these attributes and what they mean for the problem.
We decided to shift the comfortability attribute to a health attribute, as we felt that it was more relevant to the
topic.
We discussed the health impact of travelling in great detail in Section~\ref{sec:health-consequences}, but we could not
implement it in the program due to a few reasons.

First of all was the complexity of the attribute.
Health is a wide topic, so we can't just calculate and narrow it down to a single number.
Our idea was a hardcoded value for different types of transport, but health is very case dependend.
For example biking considered healthy, because you move your body, but if we also include comfortability in the rating,
then we would get conflicting results.
Health can also be very subjective, as some people might find biking relaxing, while others might find it stressful.
So at the end, we decided against implementing it.
