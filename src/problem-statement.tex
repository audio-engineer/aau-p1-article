\chapter{Problem statement}\label{ch:problem-statement}

Now we want to define the problem statement.


\section{Deviation}\label{sec:deviation}

In a modern world interconnected through both highways, rails, airports or roads, where people have the means to take
the climate and other things into account, when planning their routes to work or education.
The issue is that not enough people actually do this.
We believe the reason for this is that there is no easy way to get this information, and by giving them a way through
our app to plan their route for their preferences many more would try it.


\section{Statement}\label{sec:statement}

How can we help individuals choose a commuting route that best suits their preferences?


\section{Under questions}\label{sec:under-questions}

What can we do to inform commuters about the financial cost, time, comfort or environmental impact that different forms
of transportation can cause.
What are the parameters that affect the choices.
How can we help individuals make a choice on whether to move closer to their place of occupation or to commute from
their current place of living?
